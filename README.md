### Brain games

This is my first training project on [Hexlet.io](https://ru.hexlet.io) course.

"Brain games" — a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again. Games:

-   Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
-   Progression. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
-   Definition of an even number.
-   Determination of the greatest common divisor.
-   Definition of a Prime number.
